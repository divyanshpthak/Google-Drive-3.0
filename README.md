# Google Drive 3.0 - Basic Blockchain-Powered File Storage

Google Drive 3.0 is a simple implementation of a file storage system that utilizes blockchain technology as its underlying framework. This project demonstrates a basic version of Google Drive, focusing on image storage and retrieval. The smart contract powering this project has been deployed to the Goerli Test Network, making it a Georli blockchain-based application.

## Features

- **Blockchain-Powered Storage:** Google Drive 3.0 leverages blockchain technology to provide secure and immutable storage for image files.

- **Goerli Test Network:** The smart contract for this project has been deployed to the Goerli Test Network, allowing for testing and development without using real Ether.

- **Image Support:** This version of Google Drive supports the storage and retrieval of image files.

- **Share Access:** Share access to your images with others by setting permissions through the smart contract, enabling collaborative viewing of stored images.

- **Access Shared Images:** If granted access, users can view images uploaded by others, fostering seamless collaboration.

- **IPFS Integration:** Images are stored using IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) through Pinata, ensuring decentralized and efficient image storage.

## Getting Started

To interact with Google Drive 3.0, follow these steps:

1. **Connect to the Goerli Test Network:** Ensure that you are connected to the Goerli Test Network using an Ethereum wallet like MetaMask.

2. **Access the Interface:** Open the Google Drive 3.0 interface by navigating to [https://googledriveweb3.netlify.app](https://googledriveweb3.netlify.app).

3. **Upload Images:** Use the interface to upload image files to the blockchain-based storage system.

4. **Share Access:** Share access to specific images by assigning permissions to Ethereum addresses through the smart contract.

5. **View Uploaded Images:** Uploaded images can be viewed and accessed using the interface.

6. **Access Shared Images:** If given access, users can also view images uploaded by others.

## Technologies Used
